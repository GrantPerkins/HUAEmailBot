Hello [xyz] MFA Program,
</br></br>
I hope this email finds you well.
</br></br>
I am an editor at hex, a new online literary magazine based at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. We publish speculative flash fiction and prose poetry <1000 words. We like it weird. A piece we published last year, Parth Shah's "My Uncle Lived in the Future," was recently selected for a reprint in Best Microfiction 2023.
</br></br>
We are currently open for free submissions and would love to receive work from your community of writers. We especially encourage submissions from BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ writers, writers with disabilities, and early-career writers.
</br></br>
You can learn more about us and find submission details at <a href="https://hexliterary.com/">https://hexliterary.com/</a> and follow us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/hexliterary">@hexliterary</a>.
</br></br>
Would it be possible for you to share this note with colleagues, current students, and/or alums?
</br></br>
Thank you very much for your time and best wishes,
</br>
